In this demo, one can understand, how FortiSOAR ingests the CISA's ICS Advisories, automates the enrichment of CVEs using KEV catalogue (Known Exploitable Vulnerability), does Asset Correlations and raises an Alert if there is match found for Asset and a CVE having a Known Exploit. Further, it leverages the SSVC model for risk scoring of the Vulnerabilities and helps to orchestrate the process, leading to remediation recommendations/actions and Reporting.",

A practical use case is shown, where an alert from FAZ is enriched in FortiSOAR using threat intelligence and machine learning inputs. Next, the affected asset is isolated in FortiEMS post an approval received from the SOC admin on Slack. Once the machine is cleaned up, its shown how it can be quickly brought back up. FortiSOAR comprehensively integrates with all the Fortinet Fabric solutions, also allowing you to leverage 500+ other third-party security product integrations to design your response regime effectively and easily.",
